# VeChain grant application

## Project Overview 

- Project: VeRoyalties
- Team Name: VeRoyalties
- Payment Address: USDT (ERC 20) payment address. 0x66646b0d409c2f91f571ae91140a2da74e7f32c1

### Overview

- VeRoyalties is a project aiming to democratise real estate investment and allow anyone in the world to access the biggest market on the planet while having the utmost transparency, security and sustainability. VeRoyalties is the first NFT/Real Estate project built on the VeChain blockchain.

Whether you are an established real estate investor or not, VeRoyalties offers everyone the opportunity to buy and sell NFTs allowing access to real estate royalties in a secure, transparent and environmentally friendly way.

- We love the VeChain community being retail investors ourselves for a long time, we totally share the values you convey (Transparency, sustainability, security, trust) and it makes sense for us to build here.

Moreover there are competitive advantages like low gas fees, fee delegation technology, faster transaction confirmation times, green blockchain.

- VeRoyalties will integrate public VeChain Thor tools such as Thorify, Sync2 and will leverage the VeChain VIP library;
Technology stack used, connex, sync2, PFS for provenance, VIP180 & VIP181.

### Project Details

The images for our website interface are coming, we are currently working on the UX/UI aspect for our MVP.

Front End:

- NextJS (React + Styled Components)

Back End:

- NestJS (NodeJS + Express)
- Redis for queue management with Bull Queue
- PostgreSQL as DBMS
- Architecture managed with AWS with EC2, RDS, ElasticCache and Load Balancers
- IPFS File Storage

### Ecosystem Fit

It exists in a Centralized way, on the other hand decentralized or using the blockchain it probably exists as well, but I don't personally know of any that do what we do (accessibility from 10€ on a green blockchain...)

## Development Roadmap 

We will constantly seek to improve the user experience and the technical interface that we have, this will obviously involve upstream recruitment but the funds will mainly be there to allow an opening node and generate cash flow allowing flexibility of movement.

See also the roadmap in our whitepaper.

## Future Plans

For 2023, we want to reach a property management of 10M euros, in the longer term it would obviously be to exploit a wider geographical area (Europe...). 
Why not also exploit the crosschain solution to further expand the market. 

## Additional Information 

Currently we want this grant to carry out part of our business model through the opening of the node, and to have cash flow for possible future costs.

We don't intend to apply for other grants, we think that this one makes sense and not another one, we don't intend to raise funds in the long run because we also think that this project can bootstrap very well and be self-financing through its business model.
