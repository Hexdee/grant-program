### Overview

- VeRoyalties is a project aiming to democratise real estate investment and allow anyone in the world to access the biggest market on the planet while having the utmost transparency, security and sustainability. VeRoyalties is the first NFT/Real Estate project built on the VeChain blockchain.

Whether you are an established real estate investor or not, VeRoyalties offers everyone the opportunity to buy and sell NFTs allowing access to real estate royalties in a secure, transparent and environmentally friendly way.

- We love the VeChain community being retail investors ourselves for a long time, we totally share the values you convey (Transparency, sustainability, security, trust) and it makes sense for us to build here.

Moreover there are competitive advantages like low gas fees, fee delegation technology, faster transaction confirmation times, green blockchain.

### Ecosystem Fit

Centralized without the blockchain aspect it exists afterwards in web3 most probably, to say no would be pretentious on the other hand I don't personally know of any project doing the same (Access by NFTs at the price of 10€ for full accessibility with sound and sustainable values and ambitions).

## Future Plans

For 2023, we want to reach a property management of 10M euros, in the longer term it would obviously be to exploit a wider geographical area (Europe...). 
Why not also exploit the crosschain solution to further expand the market. 

## Additional Information 

Currently we want this grant to carry out part of our business model through the opening of the node, and to have cash flow for possible future costs.

We don't intend to apply for other grants, we think that this one makes sense and not another one, we don't intend to raise funds in the long run because we also think that this project can bootstrap very well and be self-financing through its business model.

For more information, do not hesitate to contact me privately.
