# VeChain grant application

## Project Overview 

- Project: VeRoyalties
- Team Name: VeRoyalties
- Payment Address: USDT (ERC 20) payment address. 0x66646b0d409c2f91f571ae91140a2da74e7f32c1

### Overview

- VeRoyalties is a project aiming to democratise real estate investment and allow anyone in the world to access the biggest market on the planet while having the utmost transparency, security and sustainability. VeRoyalties is the first NFT/Real Estate project built on the VeChain blockchain.

Whether you are an established real estate investor or not, VeRoyalties offers everyone the opportunity to buy and sell NFTs allowing access to real estate royalties in a secure, transparent and environmentally friendly way.

- We love the VeChain community being retail investors ourselves for a long time, we totally share the values you convey (Transparency, sustainability, security, trust) and it makes sense for us to build here.

Moreover there are competitive advantages like low gas fees, fee delegation technology, faster transaction confirmation times, green blockchain.

- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit

Centralized without the blockchain aspect it exists afterwards in web3 most probably, to say no would be pretentious on the other hand I don't personally know of any project doing the same (Access by NFTs at the price of 10€ for full accessibility with sound and sustainable values and ambitions).

### Team's experience

Certain has been in the real estate business since he was a child, we have a real network of real estate entrepreneurs and investors, many of whom make their living from this sector today.

Others have more technological and web3 expertise, which is what defines our legitimacy today to create this project.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

## Future Plans

For 2023, we want to reach a property management of 10M euros, in the longer term it would obviously be to exploit a wider geographical area (Europe...). 
Why not also exploit the crosschain solution to further expand the market. 

## Additional Information 

Currently we want this grant to carry out part of our business model through the opening of the node, and to have cash flow for possible future costs.

We don't intend to apply for other grants, we think that this one makes sense and not another one, we don't intend to raise funds in the long run because we also think that this project can bootstrap very well and be self-financing through its business model.
